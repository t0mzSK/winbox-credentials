# winbox-credentials
# WinBox credentials stealer winbox_stealer.py is a simple Python script for Windows that retrieves host, login and password from an unencrypted "settings.cfg.viw" file. I wrote this script, because earlier I downloaded WinBox and noticed that it runs pretty fast with no lags whatsoever. I was searching where are the files for the WinBox app stored. I encountered a file named "settings.cfg.viw", opened it and found out the credentials are stored here.  # Problem This isn't any type of an exploit or a serious vulnerability, but it might be a problem sometimes. Really anyone can run this script or even manually view the file. It can be a problem for anybody who shares a PC with this file and cares about security and privacy.   # Solution There isn't any solution to people who have a tons of WinBox sessions stored, or it's not comfortable for them to manually type their password. I believe only possible solution is to uncheck "Keep Password" (which still leaks the host and login) in the right corner in WinBox app.  # Usage python winbox_stealer.py  or call it directly - "cmd /k winbox_stealer.py"
